# Taxi-Booking-

The Taxi Booking App is a web application designed to provide users with a convenient way to book taxis. The application consists of user interfaces for customers and administrators. It leverages Java Spring Boot for backend development, Thymeleaf for server-side rendering of HTML, Spring Security for authentication and authorization, and an admin panel for managing the application.

JPA/Hibernate: Manages database interactions and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).

MySQL/PostgreSQL: For persistent data storage.

Maven/Gradle: For project management and dependency resolution.

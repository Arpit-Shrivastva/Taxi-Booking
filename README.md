# Taxi-Booking-

The Taxi Booking App is a web application designed to provide users with a convenient way to book taxis. The application consists of user interfaces for customers and administrators. It leverages Java Spring Boot for backend development, Thymeleaf for server-side rendering of HTML, Spring Security for authentication and authorization, and an admin panel for managing the application.

The taxi booking app is developed using Java Spring Boot for the backend, providing robust APIs for managing bookings, users, and ride details. The frontend is built with Thymeleaf, allowing dynamic content rendering and seamless integration with the backend. Spring Security ensures secure authentication and authorization for both users and admins, protecting sensitive data and functionalities. The app uses MySQL for efficient database management, storing user, driver, and booking information. This combination of technologies ensures a secure, scalable, and responsive taxi booking experience for users.
